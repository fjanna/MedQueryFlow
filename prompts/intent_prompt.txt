- diagnostic_request: user is seeking likely diagnoses, symptom interpretation, or differential guidance
- care_advice: lifestyle, prevention, or "can I do X" style guidance
- emotional_support: emotional, experiential, or anecdotal questions best served with an empathetic tone
- other: non-medical or out-of-domain
Return JSON ONLY with keys `intent` and `confidence` (0-1 float). Example:
{"intent": "medical_fact", "confidence": 0.92}
